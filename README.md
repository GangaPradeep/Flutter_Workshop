# Flutter_Workshop
This is the repository for the flutter code that we have created in the workshop. 

The changes you need to do in your pc for working the code

1. Delete all the files in the "lib" folder in the app folder and add these files to that folder

2. Add this dependency to the pubspec.yml file in your code (Add it after  "cupertino_icons: ^0.1.3"  in the pubspec.yml)
    google_fonts: ^1.1.0
3. Try to run it now
